This repository contains selected solution and cloud architecture artifacts that I created across my last three professional experiences.
The content is intentionally non-proprietary and focuses on architectural thinking, structure, and design decisions rather than on business-specific implementations.

The objective is to demonstrate how I approach end-to-end solution architecture, from scope definition and architectural views to detailed design and implementation patterns.

Repository Contents

1️⃣ Solution and Cloud Architecture Scope and Structure
  - Definition of architectural scope and boundaries
  - High-level conceptual, logical, and physical views
  - Cloud and solution architecture structuring principles
  - Alignment between business requirements and technical architecture

2️⃣ Architecture and Design Description – Past Three Experiences
  - Architecture and design descriptions derived from real professional contexts
  - System decomposition, component interactions, and integration patterns
  - Design rationales, constraints, and trade-offs
  - Focus on scalability, resiliency, security, and maintainability

3️⃣ Building REST APIs with Spring Boot (Code Snippets)
  - Practical implementation examples supporting architectural decisions
  - RESTful API design principles
  - Layered architecture, controller/service/repository separation

🎯 Intended Audience
This repository is intended for:
  - Solution Architects
  - Cloud Architects
  - Technical Leads
  - Architecture-focused hiring managers and recruiters

It is especially relevant for roles involving:
- Cloud and hybrid architectures (Azure and AWS) – design and implementation of scalable, resilient, and cost-optimized cloud solutions.
- Distributed systems and microservices architectures – end-to-end system decomposition, orchestration, and runtime integration.
- API-driven integration patterns for enterprise systems – RESTful APIs, microservices communication, and enterprise service integration.
- Architecture governance, standards, and design documentation – including conceptual, logical, and physical views aligned with best practices.
- Data governance and Master Data Management (metadata, MDM) – ensuring data quality, consistency, and compliance across systems.
- Data pipelines, ETL, and feature engineering – design of batch and streaming ETL pipelines (including Hydro dataset examples), feeding curated and validated data to  analytics and ML pipelines (covering /staging, /raw, /validated, and /curated zones).
- Data lake and data warehouse architectures – star-schema modeling, SQL and NoSQL integration, and structured storage for analytics and reporting.
- Architecture of machine learning and NLP pipelines – scalable, microservice-based architectures exposing models via APIs, integrating feature stores, batch/real-time inference, and orchestration.

🔐 Important Note
  - All materials shared in this repository are:
  - Created by me
  - Free of proprietary, confidential, or client-specific information
  - Provided solely for demonstration of architectural approach and technical skills
