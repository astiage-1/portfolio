This repository contains selected solution and cloud architecture artifacts that I created across my last three professional experiences.
The content is intentionally non-proprietary and focuses on architectural thinking, structure, and design decisions rather than on business-specific implementations.

The objective is to demonstrate how I approach end-to-end solution architecture, from scope definition and architectural views to detailed design and implementation patterns.

Repository Contents
1️⃣ Solution and Cloud Architecture Scope and Structure
  - Definition of architectural scope and boundaries
  - High-level conceptual, logical, and physical views
  - Cloud and solution architecture structuring principles
  - Alignment between business requirements and technical architecture

2️⃣ Architecture and Design Description – Past Three Experiences
  - Architecture and design descriptions derived from real professional contexts
  - System decomposition, component interactions, and integration patterns
  - Design rationales, constraints, and trade-offs
  - Focus on scalability, resiliency, security, and maintainability

3️⃣ Building REST APIs with Spring Boot (Code Snippets)
  - Practical implementation examples supporting architectural decisions
  - RESTful API design principles
  - Layered architecture, controller/service/repository separation

🎯 Intended Audience
This repository is intended for:
  - Solution Architects
  - Cloud Architects
  - Technical Leads
  - Architecture-focused hiring managers and recruiters

It is especially relevant for roles involving:
  - Cloud and hybrid architectures (Azure / AWS)
  - Distributed systems and microservices
  - API-driven integration and enterprise systems
  - Architecture governance and design documentation
  - Data governance and MDM, data lake and data warehouse architectures, and star-schema–based data modeling across SQL and NoSQL technologies
  - Architecture of machine learning and NLP pipelines exposed through scalable, microservice-oriented design

🔐 Important Note
  - All materials shared in this repository are:
  - Created by me
  - Free of proprietary, confidential, or client-specific information
  - Provided solely for demonstration of architectural approach and technical skills
